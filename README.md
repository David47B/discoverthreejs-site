## Developer Guide

Here is the process for building and viewing the book.

Prerequisites: Node.js, [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Download the Hugo _extended_ binary for your system [here](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) and place it in the project root. Tested with Hugo V0.92.0 (_\*_)
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`
5. Go to `http://localhost:1313/` to view the site. You may need to make sure this port is open in your firewall.

_\*_ On linux systems you may need to set the `./hugo` file as executable using `chmod +x ./hugo`.

## Technical Details

The book is built with Hugo, and this repo follows a fairly typical folder structure for a Hugo project, although the `content/` folder has been renamed to `markdown/`. If you want to make changes, refer to [the Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

### Important folders

- `markdown` - all the words in the book are contained here.
- `assets/src` - JS source code.
- `assets/scss` - SCSS styles for the book are here.
- `static` - all static files such as figures, fonts, models, textures, images, and favicons are here.
- `static/examples` - the code for the IDE examples are here. Each example is a `World` - for examples: `static/examples/worlds/first-steps/first-scene` contains the example for the chapter **First Scene**. See `static/examples/README.md` for more details.
- `/public` - files generated by Hugo with the command `npm run production` will go here. By default, in development Hugo renders files into memory, however, it can be useful to generate the files if you need to examine them.

## Notes

- [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/) are used to build [SCSS](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/scss-sass/) and [JS](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/js/) assets. This means the Hugo extended version must be used.
- Running `npm start` will take several seconds to bundle all the files so please be patient. However, once the server is running, updates should take just a few milliseconds.
