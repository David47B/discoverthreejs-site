  Use this to organize the way text wraps around an iframe or figure:

  {{< clear >}}
  {{< inlineScene entry="first-steps/toy-train-rotated.js" class="small right" >}}

  Use sparingly - it has to be carefully checked and tuned for mobile and usually required
  paragraphs to be split up to work nicely.
